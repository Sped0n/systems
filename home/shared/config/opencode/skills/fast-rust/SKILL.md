# fast-rust

Concise guidance for high-quality Rust engineering, balancing correctness, maintainability, and performance.

## Purpose and Triggers

- Writing new code, refactoring, reviewing, or designing public APIs/CLIs.
- Rust or files with `.rs`.
- Prefer clear boundaries, error semantics, and evolvability.

## Decision Order

1. Correctness and clear boundaries
2. Readability and maintainability
3. Extensibility and evolution cost
4. Performance and optimization

## Workflow

1. Locate the relevant topic below.
2. Apply the guidance and examples.
3. Read the reference if you need more detail.
